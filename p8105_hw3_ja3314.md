Problem 1
---------

Reading and cleaning BRFSS data:

``` r
brfss_df = filter(brfss_smart2010, Topic == "Overall Health", !is.na(Response)) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(response = factor(response, levels = c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")))
```

States that were observed at 7 locations in 2002:

``` r
brfss_df %>% 
  filter(year == 2002) %>%
  distinct(locationdesc, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  count(locationabbr) %>%
  filter(n == 7) %>% 
  pull(locationabbr) %>% 
  abbr2state()
```

    ## [1] "Connecticut"    "Florida"        "North Carolina"

Spaghetti plot of number of locations in each state in 2002-2010:

``` r
brfss_df %>%
  group_by(locationabbr, year) %>%
  distinct(locationdesc, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n, color = locationabbr)) +
           geom_line(size = 0.3)
```

Make a table showing, for the years 2002, 2006, and 2010, the mean and standard deviation of the proportion of “Excellent” responses across locations in NY State.

``` r
brfss_df %>%
  filter(year == 2002 | year == 2006 | year == 2010) %>% 
  filter(locationabbr == "NY") %>% 
  select(year, locationabbr, locationdesc, response, sample_size) %>% 
  group_by(locationdesc, year) %>% 
  mutate(sum = sum(sample_size)) %>%
  filter(response == "Excellent") %>%
  mutate(prop_excel = sample_size/sum) %>%
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(mean(prop_excel), sd(prop_excel))
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 3
    ##    year `mean(prop_excel)` `sd(prop_excel)`
    ##   <int>              <dbl>            <dbl>
    ## 1  2002              0.248           0.0398
    ## 2  2006              0.218           0.0387
    ## 3  2010              0.203           0.0460

For each year and state, compute the average proportion in each response category (taking the average across locations in a state). Make a five-panel plot that shows, for each response category separately, the distribution of these state-level averages over time.

``` r
brfss_df %>% 
  select(year, locationabbr, locationdesc, response, sample_size) %>%
  group_by(locationabbr, year) %>%
  mutate(sum_state = sum(sample_size)) %>% 
  group_by(response, locationabbr, year) %>% 
  mutate(sum_response = sum(sample_size)) %>% 
  mutate(prop = sum_response/sum_state) %>%
  select(year, locationabbr, prop) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = prop)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_grid(~response)
```
